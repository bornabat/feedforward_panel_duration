# Feed-forward estimation in panel duration models
## Borna Bateni
This repository implements the model for the 2022 paper "Feed-forward Estimation in Panel Duration Models" by borna bateni. The code input is a matrix of panel outcomes in the form of grouped durations, and whether the outcome is censored. It also inputs a 3d matrix of panel observed explanatory variables. It then computes the estimated coefficients of the observed covariates.
